## About 
The Phoenix Lander landed on Mars in 2008 where it stayed for 5 months with the goal of better understanding the geomorphology, climate, and habitatility of the Martian arctic. It was the first mission to explore the ground level of the Arctic region of Mars, and Canada's first time on the Martian surface. The Canadian componenent of the Phoenix Lander was the MET Instrument, used to track daily & seasonal weather patterns and was the first to detect snow on Mars.
